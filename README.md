# UNCHAINED Character Controller
### A work by Thomas Berger

__What is the UNCHAINED Character Controller?__

The UCC, for UNCHAINED Character Controller, is a custom character movement component (with all its linked mechanics and features) that I'm currently developping for my school team project, UNCHAINED. The player will be able to run around, dash, double jump, wall ride, and even use a grapple hook to swing in the environment.

The UCC we be updated every week, as more feature will be added to it.
